This is a repository for my compiler theory project and other related documents.
the code can be found the the src folder.

To use the application simply run `python3 main.py some_input_path some_output_path` from the src folder. The compiler will write llvm assembly to the given output path. Test programs are located in the test folder. runtime is not currently supported.
